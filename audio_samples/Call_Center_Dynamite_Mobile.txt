[SPEAKER 1:] Hello, and thanks for calling dynamite mobile. My name's Jack. How can I help you today?
[SPEAKER 2:] Hi. I'm looking to change my phone service. I was hoping to find out more information on dynamite mobile and possibly switch over.
[SPEAKER 1:] Great. I'd be happy to help with that. To start, could you provide me with your name and a phone number just to check if we can port your number over to dynamite mobile?
[SPEAKER 2:] Oh, sure. My name is Mary Jones. My phone number is five six six two five three one two one two.
[SPEAKER 1:] Excellent. Nice to meet you, Mary, and I have good news. It looks like that phone number will be fine to switch over if you decide to. Now for the next step, would you please provide me with an address? It's just to check if we can service your area.
[SPEAKER 2:] Yes. My address is two two two Jefferson Street, San Jose, California nine four one eight eight.
[SPEAKER 1:] Thank you. One second here. Ok. Great. We do service your area. If you decide you wanna switch to dynamite mobile, it should be a nice, smooth transition. Now onto the plan, how much data do you generally use? It's ok if you aren't too sure.
[SPEAKER 2:] Well, my current plan is for five giga bun... bytes a month, but I seem to always go over and incur a fee. That's part of the reason I want to switch. My current service is so expensive.
[SPEAKER 1:] Well, I think that we can start saving you money right away if you switch. We have a variety of plans available, but you'd probably be most comfortable in our ten gigabyte plan or even our unlimited. How much does your data cost right now at your current phone service?
[SPEAKER 2:] My gigs... my five gigs a month is fifty dollars, plus they add another fifteen for every gig I go over the limit.
[SPEAKER 1:] Oh, wow. That's quite a bit in my experience with phone plans. Our ten gigabyte plan is only fifty dollars a month. So you're already doubling your value there. Of course, if you'd like to be less reserved with your data usage, you can spring for the unlimited plan. It's a little more expensive at seventy five dollars a month, but you can feel free to stream and scroll as much as your heart desires without being penalized. We don't even slow down the data after ten gigs like some services do. That's peace of mind sells itself in my opinion. But I'm just here to give you all the information, not trying to sell you anything. The choice is all yours.
[SPEAKER 2:] Wow. Those prices are so much better, and I do appreciate that. I had no idea my current plan was so expensive compared to what I could be paying. I think I wanna start with the ten gigabyte plan. But what if I wanna switch later?
[SPEAKER 1:] That's no problem at all. Our phone app makes it easy to switch data plans. You just press a button. In the next month, you will have unlimited data.
[SPEAKER 2:] That does sound easy. Wow. I was wondering if I... you could carry the newest generation of phones. Mine is pretty old. I kind of wanna get an brand new one just to last me a few years.
[SPEAKER 1:] Yeah. We sure do. All of our stores have the most current models on display to help you decide, and we even offer financing an upgrade program if you decide to go that route. Also, just out of curiosity, what do you look for in a phone? I know for me, personally, I like to have a lot of storage space, 'cause I play, like, a ton of games. What about you?
[SPEAKER 2:] Yeah. I really like to use my camera. I also run a small business, so I like to have something that's easy to navigate and quick to help with, like, customers and things.
[SPEAKER 1:] Oh, yeah. That's good. So you probably use, like, Square and all that. What type of business do you run anyway?
[SPEAKER 2:] Yeah. I do... I run a greenhouse. So it's easy to be able to drop off plants to somebody, and then they can just pay me directly from Square.
[SPEAKER 1:] Oh, that's awesome. Well, while we're talking, I just confirmed that your local store does have every phone in stock and more. They have a few past generations if there's a specific one that you really like, so we're all good to go on that front.
[SPEAKER 2:] Oh, fantastic. I think it would be well worth it to switch over, and I appreciate all the information. Since I want a new phone as well, I suppose I will just need to go to my nearest dynamite store?
[SPEAKER 1:] Yep. Exactly. And we have a promotion going on right now. Let them know that you spoke with Jack H in customer service, and they'll take fifty percent off your first bill.
[SPEAKER 2:] Wow. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your help today.
[SPEAKER 2:] Yeah. Happy to help. You do the same, and thank you for calling dynamite mobile. Take care.
